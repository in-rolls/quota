\item Statistical significance symbols for the constant terms are suppressed. The outcomes are from the Mission Antyodya Facilities Survey from 2019. The village level outcomes have been aggregated to a GP level. The outcomes are:
                    (i) Primary Health Ctr.: Is there a primary health center?;
                    (ii) Community Health Ctr.: Is there a community health center?;
                    (iii) Maternal Health Ctr.: Is there a maternal health facility?;
                    (iv) Anemic Preg. Women: The number of anaemic pregnant women;
                    (v) Non-Stunted Children: The number of children categorized as non-stunted as per ICDS.
