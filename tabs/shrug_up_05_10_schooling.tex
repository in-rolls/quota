\item Statistical significance symbols for the constant terms are suppressed. The outcomes are from the Mission Antyodya Facilities Survey from 2019. 
                     The village level outcomes have been aggregated to a GP level. 
                     The outcomes are:
                         (i) Primary School: Is there a primary school?
                         (ii) Middle School: Is there a middle school?
                         (iii) Tot. Pri. School Students: The number of students enrolled in primary schools per 1000 people;
                         (iv) Mid-day Meal: Is there is a mid-day meal facility for students in school?
